# Todo App

Simple todo app. You can add any todo and remove it after execution. Limit is 10 todos, if add one more you will see an error message. Also it'd be an error if you try to add todo, which already in the list. Spaces in the beginning of the input are ignored. Button "Add todo" is disabled until the user enters a todo.
